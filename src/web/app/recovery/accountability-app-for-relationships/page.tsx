          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">The Accountability App Problem</h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            There are hundreds of habit-tracking and accountability apps on the market. Most share a common flaw: they rely entirely on
            self-reporting with no verification. You can check a box and lie. And when there are no consequences for lying, the
            accountability mechanism collapses.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            A 2023 study in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that self-monitoring apps had a median user retention of 14 days.
            Without external verification or meaningful stakes, the motivation to comply degrades rapidly after the initial novelty wears off.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">The Science of Loss Aversion</h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            Nobel Prize-winning research by Kahneman and Tversky established that humans are loss-averse: the pain of losing $50 is
            roughly twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining $50. This asymmetry (measured at approximately 2.0:1) is one of the
            most robust findings in behavioral economics.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            Accountability systems that leverage loss aversion — by putting your own money at risk — outperform systems that use
            rewards or social recognition alone. When you stand to lose something you already have, your follow-through rate
            increases dramatically.

        <section className="space-y-4">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Peer Verification: The Missing Ingredient</h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            The second critical component is third-party verification. An accountability system where you are the only judge of
            your own compliance is vulnerable to motivated reasoning. When a neutral third party evaluates your proof — without
            knowing who you are — the verification is objective.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            This is the difference between a to-do list and a legally-enforceable commitment. Peer-audited accountability combines
            the psychological power of loss aversion with the integrity of objective verification.
