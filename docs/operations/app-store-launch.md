# App Store Launch Plan -- Pre-Launch, Launch Day & Post-Launch
> Issue: #378
> Phase: Launch (Weeks 21-30)

## Overview

App Store launch is Styx's public debut. Both Apple App Store and Google Play Store require careful preparation: the Linguistic Cloaker must pass review, screenshots must be compelling, and the launch day playbook must coordinate press, community, and support. This doc covers the full launch plan: pre-launch checklist (T-30), launch day playbook (T=0), post-launch monitoring (T+1 to T+14), press/PR coordination, and phased rollout strategy.

#### App Description (iOS)

**Name:** Styx: Goal Accountability
**Subtitle:** Put money on your goals
**Promotional text (what's new):** "Welcome to Styx! Create your first contract, stake real money, and prove you followed through. Peer-reviewed accountability that actually works."

**Description (4000 chars max):**

```
Styx is the accountability platform where real stakes meet peer-reviewed proof.

Unlike habit trackers or gamified apps, Styx uses behavioral economics (loss aversion coefficient = 2.0) and financial escrow to make goal follow-through automatic.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. CREATE AN OATH -- Choose your goal: fitness, recovery, learning, productivity, or creative.
2. STAKE REAL MONEY -- Your stake is held securely in Stripe escrow.
3. SUBMIT PROOF -- Photo, video, or screenshot showing you did the work.
4. PEER AUDIT -- Anonymous reviewers ("Furies") verify your proof.
5. GET PAID -- Complete the goal, get your money back. Fail, and it's forfeited.

WHY STYX WORKS:
- Loss aversion makes failure 2x more painful than success feels good
- Peer audit eliminates cheating -- Furies earn rewards for correct verdicts
- Double-entry ledger ensures every dollar is trackable
- Aegis Protocol provides health guardrails (no dangerous contracts)
- Your data stays private -- we never store health information

WHO IT'S FOR:
- Anyone who has tried and failed with willpower alone
- Recovery (no-contact, sobriety, boundaries)
- Fitness goals that need extra motivation
- Learning and productivity targets
- Biohackers and quantified-self enthusiasts
- Practitioners who want better client follow-through

WHAT USERS SAY:
"[Quote from beta tester]"

PRICING:
Download free. Create contracts from $39. Platform fee: $9 per contract.
Practitioner plans: $49-$999/month.

Note: Styx is not gambling. The outcome is controlled entirely by your behavior, not chance. Real-money contracts require identity verification for stakes above $100.

### Linguistic Cloaker Validation

Before App Store submission, the Linguistic Cloaker must be verified across all user-facing text:

| Term | Cloaked Term | Location | Verified |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| bet | commitment | App copy, marketing | |
| wager | stake | Contract creation | |
| gamble | risk | FAQ, help | |
| betting pool | escrow pool | System messages | |
| odds | completion probability | Analytics | |
| payout | return | Completion screen | |
| loss | forfeit | Failure screen | |
| win | succeed | Completion modal | |
| lose | fail | Failure modal | |
| pot | stake pool | Fury system | |

**Validation script:** `bash scripts/validation/04-redacted-build-check.sh`

**Expected output:** Zero uncloaked gambling terminology in production build.

## Phased Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Day 1-3)

| Marketing push | Low-key | Let organic discovery work first |
| Paid acquisition | $0 | Bootstrap mode |
| Beta user upgrade | Notified but optional | Existing users can stay in beta mode |
| Contract types | Recovery, Biological, Cognitive | Start with most proven categories |
| Maximum stake | $199 | Limit financial risk during soft launch |
| KYC threshold | $100+ stakes | Ensure compliance before scaling amounts |

### Phase 2: Scaled Launch (Day 4-14)

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Marketing push | Medium | Start social media campaign, content marketing |
| Paid acquisition | $0 (organic only) | Evaluate conversion before spending |
| Practitioner onboarding | Accelerate | Convert beta practitioners to paid |
| Contract types | Add Professional, Creative | Expand use cases |
| Maximum stake | $499 | Increase for verified users |
| Referral program | Active | Turn users into acquisition channel |

### Phase 3: Full Launch (Week 3+)

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|

| B2B sales motion | Active | Dedicated practitioner outreach |
| All contract types | 7 categories | Full product vision |
| Maximum stake | $2,000 | Premium contracts available |
| Enterprise tier | Active | B2B self-serve portal |

### Rollout Decision Gates

| Gate | Criteria | If Not Met |
|------|----------|------------|
| Gate 1: Day 3 | Crash-free > 99.5%, error rate < 1%, NPS > 30 | Pause Phase 2, fix stability |
| Gate 2: Day 7 | Sign-ups > 500, activation rate > 50%, App Store rating > 3.5 | Extend Phase 1, improve onboarding |
| Gate 3: Day 14 | Retention (week 1) > 40%, completion rate > 55%, support tickets manageable | Pause Phase 3, fix product |
| Gate 4: Week 4 | Revenue (if live money), NPS > 30, growth rate sustainable | Adjust strategy or timeline |

## Launch Risks & Contingencies

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| App Store rejection (gambling) | Medium | Critical | Linguistic Cloaker validation; pre-submission review notes; legal opinion ready |
| Server overload from viral traffic | Low | High | Pre-scale to Pro tier at 300 users; monitoring + auto-alert |
| Negative press / gambling accusations | Medium | Medium | FAQ pre-drafted; crisis PR protocol; legal counsel on standby |
| Low conversion (download -> contract) | Medium | High | A/B test onboarding during soft launch |
| Competitor response (Beeminder/StickK) | Low | Low | Monitor; no direct response unless provoked |
| Stripe flags as high-risk post-launch | Low | Critical | Clean transaction history; compliance documentation; risk review prepared |
| Android fragmentation issues | Medium | Medium | Test on top 10 devices; crash reporting for quick detection |
