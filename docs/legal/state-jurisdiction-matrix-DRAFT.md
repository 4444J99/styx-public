# State Jurisdiction Matrix — 50 States + DC

> **DRAFT — REQUIRES COUNSEL SIGN-OFF.**
> Generated 2026-07-30 from the code that actually enforces jurisdiction policy. This
> matrix reports what the platform **does**, not what it should do; every "OPEN
> QUESTION" is a decision only counsel can close. Statute citations are drawn from
> `docs/legal/legal--50-state-skill-contest-survey.md` (the survey) and are **not**
> encoded in the enforcement code unless the "Code-encoded hook" column says so.

## Sources of Truth (read before the table)

1. **Compile-time tier map:** `STATE_TIERS` in `src/api/services/geofencing.ts`.
   Fail-closed: unknown/non-US/unlisted → `TIER_3 HARD_BLOCK`
   (`classifyJurisdiction`).
2. **Runtime DB registry:** `jurisdictions` table seeded to match the code map
   (`src/api/database/migrations/010_settlements_and_jurisdictions.sql`), read via
   `CompliancePolicyService.getJurisdictionPolicy`
   (`src/api/src/modules/compliance/compliance-policy.service.ts`), admin-updatable
   with TruthLog audit (`src/api/src/modules/admin/admin.controller.ts`).
   **GOVERNANCE OPEN QUESTION:** the TS map and the DB registry are dual sources of
   truth; an admin DB update does not change `STATE_TIERS`, which request-time guards
   read. Reconciliation policy needed.
3. **Request-time enforcement:** `src/api/src/common/guards/geofence.guard.ts` +
   `compliance-policy.service.ts` (`evaluateRequestPolicy`, `evaluateActionPolicy`).
   Missing/unresolvable location → blocked (fail-closed default).
4. **Settlement disposition:**
   `src/api/src/modules/compliance/jurisdiction-disposition.mapper.ts` —
   TIER_1 → CAPTURE; TIER_2 → REFUND; TIER_3 → REFUND; unknown → REFUND (fail-closed).
   Kill switch forces all → REFUND.

**Geofence action legend** (from `evaluateActionPolicy`):
- **FULL_ACCESS** (TIER_1): all actions permitted.
- **REFUND_ONLY** (TIER_2): contract creation, dispute filing, and ticket purchase
  blocked (`JURISDICTION_REFUND_ONLY_RESTRICTED`); proof submission and reads allowed.
- **HARD_BLOCK** (TIER_3): all monetized actions blocked (`JURISDICTION_BLOCKED`).

**Counsel-status legend:**
- **ALIGNED** — code tier matches the survey recommendation.
- **CODE-CONSERVATIVE** — code is stricter than the survey; counsel may relax.
- **⚠ OPEN QUESTION** — code is **more permissive** than the survey recommendation, or
  a governance question exists. These rows are the sign-off blockers.

## Sign-Off Blockers (rank ordered)

> **Resolved 2026-07-31 — NV, SD, AZ, MT.** These were blockers 1–3 and are now
> closed in the fail-safe direction rather than left open: all four are `TIER_3
> HARD_BLOCK` in both `STATE_TIERS` and the `jurisdictions` registry (migration
> `066_jurisdiction_survey_reconciliation.sql`). The code is no longer more
> permissive than our own survey **in these four states** — OR and RI remain open
> below. **This is not counsel sign-off** — it
> removes the exposure while the question is open. Counsel may relax any of them;
> reversing requires a new migration *and* the `STATE_TIERS` edit in the same change.

1. **OR / RI** — TIER_1 in code with any-chance history per survey. Now the only
   rows where the code may be more permissive than the survey.
2. **Dual source of truth** — `STATE_TIERS` (compile-time, used by guards) vs.
   `jurisdictions` DB (runtime, admin-editable). Define which one counsel's sign-off
   binds and add a reconciliation check (candidate: extend
   `scripts/validation/09-realm-sync-check.ts` pattern).
3. **No statutory hooks encoded for TIER_1** — the code carries rationale comments
   only for restricted states. Once counsel signs off, per-state statutory citations
   should be added to the `jurisdictions` table (`legal_basis_ref` column pattern
   already exists on `settlement_runs`).

## What Cannot Drift Silently

Fail-closed properties that hold regardless of matrix errors: unknown state → HARD_BLOCK
(`classifyJurisdiction`), unknown tier at settlement → REFUND
(`jurisdiction-disposition.mapper.ts`), missing location → blocked
(`compliance-policy.service.ts`), kill switch → all REFUND. The worst case of a wrong
row in this matrix is lost revenue in an over-blocked state or exposure in NV/SD-style
under-blocked states — the latter is exactly what counsel review must close.
